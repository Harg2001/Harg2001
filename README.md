# 👾 Welcome to Harg's GitHub

Hi! I'm **Jeremy Harris**, known online as **Harg** — a solo indie game developer based in **Belgium**.

I'm currently working on an **action RPG in Godot**, inspired by *Diablo* and *Path of Exile*, using a **2D isometric view**. The project started in **March 2025** and is entirely self-developed. Although the repositories are private (for now), it's only because the project is still in an early and evolving phase. I sometimes share specific code snippets and design ideas with other developers on forums and Discord.

Previously, I've developed:
- Two games on Kongregate using **Flash** (2012)
- One abandoned using **GameMaker** (2024)

## 🎮 About My Work

- 🛠️ **Main focus**: Coding and game/system design
- 🎨 I use **free/open-source assets** when they fit my vision, but most of the game is custom-built
- 💻 I develop currently in **GDScript** using **Godot**
- 🌱 I'm passionate about solo game dev but aspire to build a small studio eventually
- 📚 Inspired by creative studios like **Ankama** (*Dofus*, *Wakfu*) and **Motion Twin** (*Hordes*, *Mush*)

## 🚀 Future Plans

My long-term goal is to **release the game on Steam**, but also on platforms like **Kongregate**, **Itch.io**, **GameJolt**, and possibly **Epic** or **GOG**. I intend to continue iterating and expanding the world and story through sequels, updates, or spin-offs.

I also plan to open-source parts of my future projects, especially those that are released for free or that could help the dev community.

## 🎲 Why I Make Games

My passion for game development goes back to childhood. I used to create games **on paper** to play with my family — long before I had access to a computer. I’ve always loved storytelling, strategy, and role-playing worlds like *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Shadowrun*, and *Warhammer*.
